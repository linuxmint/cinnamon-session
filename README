Design notes for the original gnome-session
===========================================

See http://live.gnome.org/SessionManagement


Installation
============

See the file 'INSTALL'. If you are not using a released version of
gnome-session (for example, if you checked out the code from git), you
first need to run './autogen.sh'.
